# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

As web developers advance in their technological pursuits, web applications have progressed to the point that developers can bundle all of their files in packages for easier consumption and to expedite the ability to share their work. As such, I have dabbled in this myself with such a progressive web application that is a simple text editor which is useful for writing quick notes and/or snippets of code.

## Installation

You can find the tech blog on Heroku at the link below:
